# BudgetPro – Monthly Budget Planner (Console)

This project was developed as part of the Programming Foundations module to illustrate how real-world budgeting tasks can be implemented using Python.

## Analysis

## Problem

Many people track monthly budgets manually, which leads to missing data, incorrect calculations, and inconsistent tracking.  
BudgetPro aims to provide users with a structured way to record income and expenses across categories, automatically compute totals, and save monthly data persistently.

## Scenario

A user starts BudgetPro at the beginning of a month and enters their income and first expenses for default categories.  
The program creates a new budget for the selected month.

If the user later runs the program again for the same month, BudgetPro loads existing data automatically from a file, allowing the user to continue adding expenses, managing categories, or exporting summaries.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to enter my income.  
- As a user, I want to enter expenses into structured categories.  
- As a user, I want to add new categories.  
- As a user, I want to delete or reset existing categories.  
- As a user, I want to export a monthly summary file.  
- As a user, I want my monthly data to be saved and reloaded automatically.

## Use Cases

- Validate period (YYYY-MM)  
- Create a new monthly budget  
- Load an existing monthly budget  
- Enter expenses  
- Add new categories  
- Delete or clear categories  
- Export a summary text file  
- Save and exit program

# Project Requirements

This application meets all three requirements:

## 1. Interactive App (Console Input)

Users can:

- Enter period (YYYY-MM)  
- Enter income  
- Enter expenses  
- Navigate a menu  
- Add/delete categories  
- Export summary  
- Exit program  

The application uses loops and menu-driven interaction with `input()`.

## 2. Data Validation

Examples:

- **Period validation:**  
  Ensures correct format `YYYY-MM`, numeric values, and valid month (01–12).
- **Income/Expense validation:**  
  Accepts only numbers and rejects negative or invalid input.
- **Category validation:**  
  Ensures no duplicate names and correct index selection.

## 3. File Processing

The program uses two file types:

### Monthly Data File (`.dat`) – Pickle  
Stores:
- income  
- categories  
- expenses per category  

Loaded automatically when the same month is selected again.

### Summary File (`.txt`)  
human-readable export for records, containing:
- income  
- expenses per category  
- total expenses  
- difference (income – expenses)  
- financial status (under/over/balanced budget)

├── main.py                       # entry point of the program
├── greet_user.py                 # user greeting
├── categories.py                 # category management
├── budget_income_expenses.py     # income, expenses, validation, summary, persistence

## How to Run


Open GitHub Codespaces or a local Python environment

Run the program with:
```
python3 main.py
```

## Libraries Used

### `pickle`
Used for saving and loading monthly data in structured Python dictionaries.  
Part of the Python standard library.
